This script can be used to build and unpack SE-CASC mods, such as UEDAIP, with Samase.

Note that Samase has significantly broader functionality that is currently not supported here (such as including icons or build numbers).

The distributable .exe version of this is meant to go to the main sezam directory (the same place window.py's in)
